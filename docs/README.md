# Payment API Security Enhancement Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Payment API Security Enhancement project. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the project's architecture, API specifications, development guides, and operational procedures.

The Payment API Security Enhancement project aims to strengthen the security of the existing payment processing system by implementing more secure authentication mechanisms while maintaining backward compatibility with current vendor integrations. The project leverages Conjur vault for credential management to replace the current header-based Client ID and Client Secret authentication method for internal service communication, while preserving the existing API contract with vendors.

## Documentation Structure
The documentation is organized into the following main sections:

### Architecture Documentation

- [Credential Rotation](architecture/credential-rotation.md): Details of the credential rotation process
- [Network Security](architecture/network-security.md): Network security considerations
- [System Boundaries](architecture/system-boundaries.md): Definition of system boundaries and interfaces

### API Documentation
API specifications and documentation for the system's interfaces.

- [Payment-EAPI](api/payment-eapi.yaml): OpenAPI specification for the external-facing API
- [Payment-SAPI](api/payment-sapi.yaml): OpenAPI specification for the internal service API

### Development Documentation

- [Disaster Recovery](operations/disaster-recovery.md): Disaster recovery procedures

## Project Overview
The Payment API Security Enhancement project implements a secure authentication mechanism using Conjur vault for credential management and token-based authentication for internal service communication, while maintaining the existing API contract with vendors.

### Key Features
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Implementation of secure credential storage using Conjur vault for Payment API authentication credentials
- **Token-based Authentication**: Implementation of token-based authentication for internal service communication
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintenance of existing API contract with XYZ Vendor while implementing enhanced security internally
- **Credential Rotation**: Ability to rotate credentials without service disruption
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Monitoring and observability for security events and system health

### System Components
The system consists of the following main components:

- **Payment-EAPI**: External-facing API that authenticates vendor requests using Client ID/Secret headers and forwards them to internal services using JWT tokens
- **Payment-SAPI**: Internal service that processes payment transactions with token-based authentication
- **Conjur Vault**: Secure storage for authentication credentials
- **Redis Cache**: Caching service for authentication tokens
- **Credential Rotation**: Service for managing secure credential rotation without disrupting existing integrations
- **Monitoring**: Service for monitoring, metrics collection, and alerting

### Technology Stack
The project uses the following technology stack:

- **Programming Language**: Java 11
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 2.6.x with Spring Security 5.6.x
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0
- **Token Management**: JJWT (Java JWT) 0.11.x
- **Credential Management**: Conjur Vault with Java client
- **Caching**: Redis 6.2.x
- **Containerization**: Docker with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube
