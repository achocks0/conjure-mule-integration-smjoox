### Component Overview

Details of each monitoring component and its role in the overall monitoring architecture.

- **Prometheus** <!-- prometheus v2.30.3 -->: Metrics collection and alerting platform. Collects metrics from various services and stores them in a time-series database.
- **Grafana** <!-- grafana 8.1.2 -->: Dashboard visualization platform. Provides a user interface for creating and visualizing dashboards based on Prometheus metrics.
- **AlertManager** <!-- alertmanager v0.23.0 -->: Alert handling system. Manages alerts generated by Prometheus and routes them to appropriate notification channels.
- **ELK Stack** <!-- elastic 7.16.x -->: Log aggregation and analysis. Collects, parses, and indexes logs from various services for troubleshooting and analysis.
- **Micrometer** <!-- micrometer 1.8.x -->: Application metrics collection. Provides a common interface for collecting metrics from Java applications.
