## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive disaster recovery (DR) plan for the Payment API Security Enhancement project. It outlines the strategies, procedures, and resources required to recover the payment processing system in the event of a major incident or disaster that disrupts normal operations.

The disaster recovery plan is designed to minimize downtime, data loss, and business impact while ensuring the security of the payment processing system during recovery operations. It covers all critical components of the system, including Payment-EAPI, Payment-SAPI, Conjur vault, Redis cache, and supporting infrastructure.

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this disaster recovery plan is to:

- Define the strategy for recovering the Payment API Security Enhancement system after a disaster
- Document detailed recovery procedures for different disaster scenarios
- Establish roles and responsibilities during disaster recovery operations
- Define recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)
- Provide guidelines for testing and maintaining the disaster recovery plan

This plan covers the following components of the Payment API Security Enhancement project:

- Payment-EAPI (External API)
- Payment-SAPI (System API)
- Conjur vault for credential management
- Redis cache for token storage
- Supporting infrastructure (Kubernetes, databases, networking)
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### Disaster Recovery Team

The Disaster Recovery Team is responsible for executing this plan during a disaster event:

| Role | Responsibilities | Primary Contact | Secondary Contact |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| DR Coordinator | Overall coordination of DR activities | [Name], [Phone], [Email] | [Name], [Phone], [Email] |
| Infrastructure Lead | Recovery of infrastructure components | [Name], [Phone], [Email] | [Name], [Phone], [Email] |
| Application Lead | Recovery of application components | [Name], [Phone], [Email] | [Name], [Phone], [Email] |
| Security Lead | Security oversight during recovery | [Name], [Phone], [Email] | [Name], [Phone], [Email] |
| Communications Lead | Stakeholder communications | [Name], [Phone], [Email] | [Name], [Phone], [Email] |

During a disaster event, the DR Coordinator will assemble the team and assign responsibilities based on the nature and scope of the disaster.

### Recovery Objectives

The following recovery objectives have been established for the Payment API Security Enhancement system:

| Component | Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | Priority |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| Payment-EAPI | 4 hours | 15 minutes | Critical |
| Payment-SAPI | 4 hours | 15 minutes | Critical |
| Conjur Vault | 2 hours | 5 minutes | Critical |
| Redis Cache | 1 hour | 15 minutes | High |
| Monitoring Systems | 8 hours | 1 hour | Medium |

These objectives represent the maximum acceptable downtime (RTO) and data loss (RPO) for each component. The actual recovery time and data loss may be less depending on the nature of the disaster and the effectiveness of the recovery procedures.

### Disaster Scenarios

This plan addresses the following disaster scenarios:

1. **Infrastructure Failure**: Failure of infrastructure components such as servers, storage, or networking

2. **Data Center Outage**: Complete loss of a data center due to power outage, natural disaster, or other causes

3. **Application Failure**: Critical failure of application components

4. **Data Corruption**: Corruption of critical data

5. **Security Breach**: Major security incident requiring system recovery

6. **Vendor Service Outage**: Failure of critical vendor services

Each scenario may require different recovery procedures, which are detailed in the respective sections of this document.

## Disaster Recovery Strategy

The disaster recovery strategy for the Payment API Security Enhancement project is based on a multi-layered approach that combines high availability within the primary region and disaster recovery capabilities in a secondary region.

### High-Level Strategy

The disaster recovery strategy consists of the following key elements:

1. **Multi-Region Deployment**: Primary production environment with a standby disaster recovery environment in a separate geographic region

2. **Regular Backups**: Comprehensive backup strategy with offsite storage

3. **Automated Recovery**: Automated recovery procedures where possible

4. **Manual Procedures**: Documented manual procedures for scenarios that cannot be fully automated

5. **Regular Testing**: Quarterly testing of disaster recovery procedures

### Recovery Approaches

Different recovery approaches are used depending on the component and disaster scenario:

| Component | Primary Approach | Alternative Approach | Data Protection |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Payment-EAPI | Redeployment from images | Restore from backup | Stateless, no data loss |
| Payment-SAPI | Redeployment from images | Restore from backup | Stateless, no data loss |
| Conjur Vault | Failover to standby | Restore from backup | Synchronous replication |
| Redis Cache | Failover to replica | Rebuild from scratch | Asynchronous replication |
| Database | Failover to standby | Restore from backup | Synchronous replication |
| Kubernetes | Redeployment of resources | Restore from backup | Configuration in Git |

The primary approach is the preferred method for recovery, while the alternative approach serves as a fallback if the primary approach fails.

### Replication and Synchronization

Data replication and synchronization mechanisms ensure that critical data is available in the DR environment:

1. **Conjur Vault**: Synchronous replication to standby instance in the same region, asynchronous replication to DR region

2. **Database**: Synchronous replication to standby instance in the same region, asynchronous replication to DR region

3. **Redis Cache**: Asynchronous replication to replicas in the same region, periodic snapshots to DR region

4. **Configuration**: All configuration stored in Git repositories, available to both primary and DR environments

5. **Container Images**: All container images stored in a registry accessible from both primary and DR environments

### Recovery Modes

The system supports different recovery modes depending on the severity of the disaster:

1. **Component Recovery**: Recovery of individual failed components while the rest of the system remains operational

2. **Region Recovery**: Recovery of all components within a region after a regional failure

3. **Full System Recovery**: Complete recovery of the entire system after a catastrophic failure

4. **Degraded Mode Operation**: Operation in a reduced capacity mode during recovery

The appropriate recovery mode is selected based on the nature and scope of the disaster, with the goal of minimizing downtime and data loss while ensuring system security.

### Security Considerations

Security remains a critical consideration during disaster recovery operations:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Maintain secure authentication and authorization mechanisms during recovery

2. **Data Protection**: Ensure encryption of sensitive data during backup, transfer, and recovery

3. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for recovery operations

4. **Audit Logging**: Maintain comprehensive audit logging during recovery

5. **Vulnerability Management**: Ensure recovered systems are not exposed to known vulnerabilities

All recovery procedures must be performed in accordance with security policies and standards to prevent security compromises during recovery operations.

## Backup and Restore

A comprehensive backup strategy is essential for successful disaster recovery. This section details the backup and restore procedures for all critical components of the Payment API Security Enhancement system.

### Backup Strategy

The backup strategy includes the following elements:

| Component | Backup Type | Frequency | Retention | Storage Location |
|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Conjur Vault | Full backup | Daily | 30 days | Encrypted S3 bucket |
| Conjur Vault | Incremental backup | Hourly | 7 days | Encrypted S3 bucket |
| Database | Full backup | Daily | 30 days | Encrypted S3 bucket |
| Database | Transaction logs | Continuous | 7 days | Encrypted S3 bucket |
| Redis Cache | RDB snapshot | Hourly | 7 days | Encrypted S3 bucket |
| Kubernetes Resources | YAML exports | Daily | 30 days | Git repository |
| Configuration | Git repository | On change | Indefinite | Git repository with multiple remotes |
| Container Images | Image registry | On build | 90 days | Container registry with replication |

All backups are encrypted and stored in multiple locations to ensure availability during disaster recovery.

### Backup Procedures

The following procedures are used for creating backups:

1. **Conjur Vault Backup**:
```bash
# Full backup of Conjur vault
conjur-backup.sh --full --output-dir /backups/conjur/$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Incremental backup of Conjur vault
conjur-backup.sh --incremental --output-dir /backups/conjur/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H)

# Upload backup to S3
aws s3 sync /backups/conjur s3://payment-api-backups/conjur/ --sse AES256
```

2. **Database Backup**:
```bash
# Full database backup
pg_dump -Fc -f /backups/database/payment_db_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump payment_db

# Upload backup to S3
aws s3 cp /backups/database/payment_db_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump s3://payment-api-backups/database/ --sse AES256

# Configure continuous WAL archiving
# In postgresql.conf:
# archive_mode = on
# archive_command = 'aws s3 cp %p s3://payment-api-backups/database/wal/%f --sse AES256'
```

3. **Redis Cache Backup**:
```bash
# Configure Redis to create RDB snapshots
# In redis.conf:
# save 3600 1

# Copy RDB file to backup location
cp /var/lib/redis/dump.rdb /backups/redis/dump_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H).rdb

# Upload backup to S3
aws s3 cp /backups/redis/dump_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H).rdb s3://payment-api-backups/redis/ --sse AES256
```

4. **Kubernetes Resource Backup**:
```bash
# Export all resources in the namespace
kubectl get all -n payment-system -o yaml > /backups/kubernetes/payment-system-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml

# Export ConfigMaps and Secrets
kubectl get configmaps -n payment-system -o yaml > /backups/kubernetes/configmaps-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml
kubectl get secrets -n payment-system -o yaml > /backups/kubernetes/secrets-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml

# Commit and push to Git repository
git add .
git commit -m "Daily backup $(date +%Y%m%d)"
git push origin master
```

### Backup Verification

Regular verification of backups is essential to ensure they can be used for recovery:

1. **Automated Verification**:
   - Checksums verified for all backup files
   - Backup completion status checked
   - Backup size and content validated against expected patterns

2. **Manual Verification**:
   - Weekly test restoration of Conjur vault backup to test environment
