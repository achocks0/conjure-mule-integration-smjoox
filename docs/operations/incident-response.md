- Stakeholders: For awareness of incident response procedures

## Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on severity, impact, and type to ensure appropriate response and prioritization.

### Severity Levels

Incidents are classified into the following severity levels:

| Severity | Description | Examples | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Critical (P1) | Complete service outage or severe security breach affecting all users | - Complete authentication failure<br>- Payment processing completely unavailable<br>- Confirmed data breach | Immediate (15 min) | < 4 hours |
| High (P2) | Partial service outage or security issue affecting many users | - Intermittent authentication failures<br>- Significant performance degradation<br>- Conjur vault unavailability | Prompt (30 min) | < 8 hours |
| Medium (P3) | Limited service impact affecting some users or functionality | - Isolated authentication failures<br>- Minor performance issues<br>- Non-critical component failures | Standard (2 hours) | < 24 hours |
| Low (P4) | Minimal service impact with acceptable workarounds | - Cosmetic issues<br>- Non-critical alerts<br>- Minor anomalies | Scheduled (8 hours) | < 5 days |

The severity level may be adjusted during incident response as more information becomes available or as the situation evolves.

### Impact Assessment

Impact is assessed across multiple dimensions to determine the overall severity:

1. **User Impact**:
   - Number of affected users or vendors
   - Criticality of affected functionality
   - Availability of workarounds

2. **Business Impact**:
   - Financial implications
   - Reputational damage
   - Regulatory or compliance concerns

3. **Technical Impact**:
   - Affected components and services
   - Data integrity or loss concerns
   - Security implications

4. **Recovery Complexity**:
   - Estimated time to resolve
   - Resource requirements
   - Dependencies on external parties

The impact assessment should be continuously updated as more information becomes available during the incident response process.

### Incident Types

Incidents are categorized by type to guide the response approach:

1. **Authentication Incidents**:
   - Authentication failures
   - Token validation issues
   - Credential management problems

2. **Security Incidents**:
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Suspicious activity patterns
   - Potential data breaches

3. **Performance Incidents**:

   - Synchronization problems

6. **Infrastructure Incidents**:
   - Kubernetes issues
   - Network problems
   - Cloud provider outages

Many incidents may span multiple categories, and the primary category may change as the incident investigation progresses.

### Incident Triggers

Incidents may be triggered through various channels:

1. **Automated Alerts**:
   - Prometheus alerts based on metric thresholds
   - Log-based alerts from ELK Stack
   - Health check failures
   - Security monitoring alerts

2. **Manual Reports**:
   - User or vendor reports
   - Operations team observations
   - Development team findings
   - Security team discoveries

3. **Proactive Monitoring**:
   - Dashboard observations
   - Trend analysis
   - Anomaly detection
   - Scheduled health checks

Specific alert thresholds and monitoring dashboards are configured in the monitoring system to detect and trigger incidents based on predefined criteria for authentication failures, performance degradation, and system availability issues.

## Incident Response Organization

Effective incident response requires clear roles, responsibilities, and coordination among team members.

### Roles and Responsibilities

The following roles are defined for incident response:

| Role | Responsibilities | Assigned To |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Incident Commander | Overall coordination, decision-making, status updates | Operations Team Lead |
| Technical Lead | Technical investigation, troubleshooting, resolution | Senior Engineer (rotational) |
| Communications Lead | Stakeholder updates, user communication | Product Manager / Operations Manager |
| Security Lead | Security assessment, forensic analysis | Security Engineer (for security incidents) |
| Subject Matter Experts | Specialized knowledge and support | Component owners (as needed) |
| Executive Sponsor | Executive decisions, resource allocation | CTO / CISO (for major incidents) |

Roles are assigned at the beginning of incident response and may be transferred as needed during the incident lifecycle. The Incident Commander is responsible for ensuring all roles are filled appropriately.

### Response Team Structure

The incident response team structure varies based on incident severity:

1. **Critical (P1) Incidents**:
   - Full response team with all roles filled
   - Executive involvement
   - Dedicated war room (physical or virtual)
   - 24/7 coverage if needed

2. **High (P2) Incidents**:
   - Core response team (Incident Commander, Technical Lead, Communications Lead)
   - SMEs as needed
   - Regular status updates
   - Extended hours coverage if needed

3. **Medium (P3) Incidents**:
   - Minimal response team (Technical Lead with Incident Commander oversight)
   - SMEs consulted as needed
   - Standard business hours coverage

4. **Low (P4) Incidents**:
   - Individual responder with escalation path
   - Standard business hours coverage

The response team structure may be adjusted during the incident as the situation evolves.

### On-Call Rotations

On-call responsibilities are managed through defined rotations:

1. **Primary On-Call**:
   - First responder for all incidents
   - Initial triage and assessment
   - Escalation to appropriate teams
   - 24/7 availability during on-call period

2. **Secondary On-Call**:
   - Backup for Primary On-Call
   - Additional support for high severity incidents
   - 24/7 availability during on-call period

3. **Specialized On-Call**:
   - Security team on-call
   - Database team on-call
   - Network team on-call
   - Called in as needed based on incident type

On-call schedules are managed through PagerDuty with weekly rotations. Handoffs between on-call personnel include a review of ongoing incidents and potential issues.

### Escalation Paths

Clear escalation paths ensure that incidents receive appropriate attention:

1. **Technical Escalation**:
   - Level 1: On-Call Engineer
   - Level 2: Technical Lead / Team Lead
   - Level 3: Engineering Manager
   - Level 4: CTO / VP of Engineering

2. **Security Escalation**:
   - Level 1: Security On-Call
   - Level 2: Security Team Lead
   - Level 3: CISO / Security Director
   - Level 4: CEO / Executive Team

3. **Business Escalation**:
   - Level 1: Product Manager
   - Level 2: Product Director
   - Level 3: VP of Product
   - Level 4: CEO / Executive Team

Escalation should occur when:
- The incident exceeds the current responder's authority or expertise
- The incident is not progressing toward resolution within expected timeframes
- The incident severity increases
- Additional resources or decision-making is required

## Incident Response Lifecycle

The incident response lifecycle defines the stages from detection to resolution and learning.

### Detection and Reporting

The incident response process begins with detection and reporting:

1. **Alert Detection**:
   - Automated alerts from monitoring systems
   - Manual observations from dashboards
   - User or vendor reports

2. **Initial Triage**:
   - Acknowledge the alert or report
   - Perform initial assessment of validity and severity
   - Determine if an incident should be declared

3. **Incident Declaration**:
   - Create an incident record in the incident management system
   - Assign initial severity level
   - Notify the appropriate on-call personnel

4. **Initial Response**:
   - Acknowledge the incident within SLA timeframe
   - Begin initial investigation
   - Determine if additional responders are needed

    Declare --> Severity{Assess Severity}
    Severity -->|P1/P2| FullTeam[Assemble Response Team]
    Severity -->|P3/P4| SingleResponder[Assign Single Responder]
```

### Assessment and Diagnosis

Once an incident is declared, the focus shifts to assessment and diagnosis:

1. **Team Assembly**:
   - Assign incident roles based on severity
   - Establish communication channels
   - Brief team on current information

2. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Determine affected components and services
   - Assess user and business impact
   - Refine severity classification if needed

3. **Technical Investigation**:
   - Analyze logs, metrics, and traces
   - Review recent changes and deployments
   - Identify potential root causes
   - Develop hypotheses and test them

4. **Status Documentation**:
   - Document findings in incident management system
   - Update status regularly
   - Maintain timeline of key events and actions

During this phase, the team should focus on understanding the incident without immediately jumping to solutions unless immediate containment is required for security incidents.

### Containment and Mitigation

After assessment, the team focuses on containment and mitigation:

1. **Containment Strategy**:
   - Determine actions to limit impact and prevent spread
   - For security incidents, isolate affected components
   - For performance incidents, reduce load or increase resources
   - For availability incidents, redirect traffic or activate failover

2. **Mitigation Actions**:
   - Implement temporary fixes or workarounds
   - Restore service functionality, potentially in degraded mode
   - Monitor effectiveness of mitigation actions
   - Adjust approach based on results

3. **Service Restoration Priority**:
   - Authentication capabilities
   - Payment processing functionality
   - Reporting and monitoring capabilities
   - Administrative functions

4. **Stakeholder Updates**:
   - Provide status updates to affected stakeholders
   - Communicate expected resolution timeline
   - Advise on any workarounds for users

The goal of this phase is to minimize the impact on users and business operations while working toward a full resolution.

### Resolution and Recovery

The resolution and recovery phase focuses on permanent fixes and full service restoration:

1. **Permanent Fix Implementation**:
   - Develop and test permanent solution
   - Implement fix with appropriate change management
   - Verify fix resolves the root cause
   - Ensure no new issues are introduced

2. **Service Verification**:
   - Verify all affected services are fully operational
   - Conduct end-to-end testing
   - Confirm normal performance and functionality
   - Verify security controls are effective

3. **Monitoring Period**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for affected components
   - Define specific metrics to watch
   - Establish alert thresholds for potential recurrence
   - Determine monitoring duration based on incident severity

4. **Incident Closure**:
   - Confirm resolution with stakeholders
   - Document final status and resolution
   - Schedule post-incident review
   - Formally close the incident

The incident is considered resolved when normal service operation is restored, and any temporary measures have been replaced with permanent solutions.

### Post-Incident Activities

After incident resolution, several activities ensure learning and improvement:

1. **Post-Incident Review (PIR)**:
   - Schedule review within 5 business days for P1/P2 incidents
   - Include all key participants and stakeholders
   - Review incident timeline and response effectiveness
   - Identify what went well and what could be improved

2. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:
   - Conduct thorough analysis of underlying causes
   - Use techniques like 5 Whys or Fishbone Diagram
   - Document technical and process-related root causes
   - Identify contributing factors

3. **Improvement Actions**:
   - Develop specific, actionable improvements
   - Assign owners and due dates
   - Track implementation progress
   - Validate effectiveness

4. **Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Update documentation and runbooks
   - Share lessons learned with wider team
   - Conduct training if needed
   - Update monitoring and alerting based on findings

The post-incident process is critical for preventing similar incidents in the future and continuously improving the incident response capability.

   - Provide updates on progress
   - Close the loop when resolved

## Post-Incident Analysis

Post-incident analysis is critical for learning from incidents and preventing recurrence.

### Post-Incident Review Process

The structured process for reviewing incidents after resolution:

1. **Scheduling**:
   - Schedule within 5 business days of resolution
   - Include all key participants
   - Allocate sufficient time (1-2 hours)
   - Distribute incident timeline before the meeting

2. **Participants**:
   - Incident Commander
   - Technical Lead
   - Key responders
   - Representatives from affected teams
   - Management representatives as appropriate
   - Facilitator (neutral party)

3. **Meeting Structure**:
   - Review incident timeline
   - Discuss what happened
   - Analyze what went well
   - Analyze what could be improved
   - Identify root causes
   - Develop action items
   - Assign owners and due dates

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document the discussion and findings
   - Distribute to participants and stakeholders
   - Store in knowledge base for future reference
   - Update runbooks and procedures based on findings

### Root Cause Analysis

Techniques for identifying the root causes of incidents:

1. **5 Whys Analysis**:
   - Start with the problem statement
   - Ask "why" the problem occurred
   - For each answer, ask "why" again
   - Continue until reaching root cause(s)
   - Typically requires 5 levels of questioning

2. **Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)**:
   - Identify main categories of potential causes
     - People
     - Process
     - Technology
     - Environment
     - Management
   - Brainstorm specific causes in each category
   - Analyze relationships between causes

3. **Fault Tree Analysis**:
   - Start with the incident (top event)
   - Identify immediate causes
   - Break down each cause into contributing factors
   - Continue until reaching basic causes
   - Analyze logical relationships (AND/OR gates)

4. **Timeline Analysis**:
   - Create detailed incident timeline
   - Identify key events and decision points
   - Analyze cause-effect relationships
   - Look for patterns and triggers

The analysis should focus on systemic issues rather than individual blame, and should consider technical, process, and organizational factors.

### Improvement Action Tracking

2. **Prioritization**:
   - High: Critical to preventing similar high-impact incidents
   - Medium: Important for process improvement
   - Low: Nice-to-have enhancements

3. **Assignment and Ownership**:
   - Assign to specific individual (not team)
   - Ensure owner has authority and resources
   - Establish clear expectations
