# Network Security Architecture

## Introduction

This document describes the network security architecture for the Payment API Security Enhancement project. Network security is a critical aspect of the overall security architecture, providing the foundation for protecting the payment processing system from external and internal threats.

The network security architecture implements defense in depth through multiple security layers, including network segmentation, access controls, encryption, and monitoring. These layers work together to protect sensitive components and data while maintaining the necessary connectivity for system operation and backward compatibility with existing vendor integrations.

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the network security architecture for the Payment API Security Enhancement project, including:

- Network security zones and boundaries
- Network segmentation approach
- Network access controls
- Encryption and secure communication
- Network monitoring and defense mechanisms

This document is intended for security architects, network engineers, system administrators, and security operations personnel involved in the implementation, maintenance, and operation of the Payment API Security Enhancement project.

### Key Requirements

The network security architecture addresses the following key requirements:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of network security controls to protect against various threats.

2. **Secure Communication**: Ensure all network communication is encrypted and authenticated.

3. **Network Segmentation**: Implement strict network segmentation to isolate security components from public-facing services.

4. **Access Control**: Implement network-level access controls between different security zones.

5. **Monitoring and Detection**: Implement comprehensive network monitoring and threat detection capabilities.

6. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing vendor integrations while enhancing security.

### Design Principles

The network security architecture is guided by the following design principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers provide redundant protection.

2. **Least Privilege**: Network access is restricted to the minimum necessary for operation.

3. **Secure by Default**: Default configurations deny access unless explicitly allowed.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between different security zones and functions.

5. **Visibility and Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of network traffic and security events.

6. **Resilience**: The network security architecture is designed to be resilient to failures and attacks.

## Network Security Zones

The network security architecture divides the system into distinct security zones, each with appropriate security controls and access restrictions. These zones create multiple security layers that must be traversed to reach sensitive components.

### Zone Definitions

The system is divided into the following security zones:

- **External Zone**: Contains external clients (XYZ Vendor) and the public internet. This zone is considered untrusted.

- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: Contains the API Gateway, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Load Balancer. This zone handles external traffic and provides the first layer of defense.

- **Application Zone**: Contains the Payment-EAPI and Redis Cache. This zone processes authenticated requests and manages token caching.

- **Internal Zone**: Contains the Payment-SAPI and backend systems. This zone processes payment transactions after authentication.

- **Security Zone**: Contains Conjur Vault and security infrastructure. This zone stores sensitive credentials and cryptographic material.

- **Monitoring Zone**: Contains logging and monitoring systems. This zone collects and analyzes security events and metrics.

```

### Zone Trust Levels

Each zone has a defined trust level that determines the security controls applied:

| Zone | Trust Level | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| External Zone | Untrusted | No trust assumptions, all traffic must be validated and authenticated |
| DMZ | Semi-trusted | Limited trust, traffic is filtered but still requires validation |
| Application Zone | Trusted | Higher trust level, but still requires authentication and authorization |
| Internal Zone | Trusted | Higher trust level, internal services with controlled access |
| Security Zone | Highly trusted | Highest trust level, contains sensitive security components |
| Monitoring Zone | Trusted | Collects and analyzes security data with controlled access |

### Zone Communication Patterns

Communication between zones follows specific patterns to maintain security:

1. **Controlled Flow**: Communication flows are strictly controlled, with explicit allow rules for necessary traffic.

2. **Directional Control**: Communication is generally initiated from lower trust zones to higher trust zones, with responses flowing back.

3. **Authentication Boundaries**: Authentication occurs at zone boundaries, with different mechanisms for different zones.

4. **Protocol Restrictions**: Only necessary protocols are allowed between zones, with secure versions required.

5. **Monitoring Points**: All cross-zone communication is monitored for security events and anomalies.

## Network Segmentation

Network segmentation is a key security control that divides the network into isolated segments, limiting the impact of a potential breach and protecting sensitive components.

### Segmentation Approach

The network segmentation approach implements multiple layers of isolation:

1. **Physical Segmentation**: Separate physical networks for different security zones where possible.

2. **VLAN Segmentation**: Virtual LANs (VLANs) to separate network traffic within shared physical infrastructure.

3. **Subnet Segmentation**: Separate IP subnets for different security zones and components.

4. **VPC Segmentation**: Separate Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) for cloud-based components.

5. **Kubernetes Namespace Segmentation**: Separate Kubernetes namespaces for containerized components.

6. **Micro-segmentation**: Fine-grained segmentation at the workload level using network policies.

### Subnet Design

The subnet design implements isolation between different security zones:

| Network | CIDR Block | Components | Access Controls |
|---------|------------|------------|----------------|
| DMZ Network | 10.1.0.0/24 | WAF, Load Balancer, API Gateway | Restricted inbound from internet, limited outbound |
| Application Network | 10.2.0.0/24 | Payment-EAPI, Redis Cache | No direct internet access, controlled access from DMZ |
| Internal Network | 10.3.0.0/24 | Payment-SAPI, Backend Systems | No direct internet access, controlled access from Application Network |
| Security Network | 10.4.0.0/24 | Conjur Vault, HSM | Highly restricted access, only from authorized components |
| Management Network | 10.5.0.0/24 | Logging, Monitoring | One-way data flow from other networks, restricted access |

### Kubernetes Network Policies

For containerized components, Kubernetes Network Policies provide additional segmentation:

```yaml
