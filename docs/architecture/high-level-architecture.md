```

## Security Architecture

The security architecture implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers to protect the payment processing system.

### Security Zones

The system is divided into distinct security zones, each with appropriate security controls and access restrictions:

- **External Zone**: Contains external clients (XYZ Vendor) and the public internet. This zone is considered untrusted.

- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: Contains the API Gateway, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Load Balancer. This zone handles external traffic and provides the first layer of defense.

- **Application Zone**: Contains the Payment-EAPI and Redis Cache. This zone processes authenticated requests and manages token caching.

- **Internal Zone**: Contains the Payment-SAPI and backend systems. This zone processes payment transactions after authentication.

- **Security Zone**: Contains Conjur Vault and security infrastructure. This zone stores sensitive credentials and cryptographic material.

Each zone has specific security controls, network segmentation, and access restrictions to implement defense in depth.

### Authentication Mechanisms

The system implements multiple authentication mechanisms across different boundaries:

1. **External Authentication**: Client ID and Client Secret in HTTP headers for vendor requests

2. **Internal Authentication**: JWT tokens for service-to-service communication

3. **Vault Authentication**: Certificate-based mutual TLS for Conjur vault access

4. **Backend Authentication**: Service-specific authentication for backend systems

The Payment-EAPI translates between external header-based authentication and internal token-based authentication, maintaining backward compatibility while enhancing security.

### Authorization Framework

The authorization framework implements a multi-layered approach:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Vendors are assigned specific roles that determine which payment operations they can perform

2. **Claims-Based Authorization**: JWT tokens contain specific claims that define service permissions

3. **Policy-Based Access**: Conjur policies define which services can access specific credentials

This layered approach ensures that authorization is enforced at multiple levels, following the principle of defense in depth.

### Data Protection

Data protection measures ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data:

1. **Encryption in Transit**: All communication uses TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites

2. **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data is encrypted when stored, including credentials in Conjur vault

3. **Token Security**: JWT tokens are signed to prevent tampering and contain only necessary claims

4. **Credential Protection**: Client Secrets are never stored in plain text, only as secure hashes

5. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is transmitted and stored

### Security Monitoring

Comprehensive security monitoring ensures visibility into security events:

1. **Authentication Monitoring**: Monitoring of authentication success/failure rates, token operations

2. **Anomaly Detection**: Detection of unusual authentication patterns or credential usage

3. **Audit Logging**: Logging of security-relevant events for compliance and investigation

4. **Alert Generation**: Alerts for security incidents based on defined thresholds

5. **Security Dashboards**: Visualization of security metrics and events

### Trust Boundaries

Trust boundaries define the points where trust levels change and additional security controls are required:

1. **External to DMZ Boundary**: Boundary between untrusted external systems and semi-trusted DMZ components

2. **DMZ to Application Boundary**: Boundary between semi-trusted DMZ and trusted application components

3. **Application to Internal Boundary**: Boundary between application components and internal services

4. **Application to Security Boundary**: Boundary between application components and security components

Each trust boundary implements appropriate security controls to protect against threats, including authentication, authorization, input validation, and monitoring. These controls ensure that as data crosses trust boundaries, it is properly validated and protected.

## Authentication Implementation

The authentication implementation is a critical aspect of the Payment API Security Enhancement project, enabling secure authentication while maintaining backward compatibility with existing vendor integrations.

### Authentication Process Overview

The authentication process handles vendor requests with Client ID and Client Secret headers, validates the credentials against those stored in Conjur vault, and generates JWT tokens for internal service communication.

```mermaid

            EAPI->>EAPI: Generate JWT Token
            EAPI->>Redis: Cache Token
        else Invalid Credentials
            EAPI-->>Gateway: Return 401 Unauthorized
            Gateway-->>Vendor: Return 401 Unauthorized
        end
    end
    
    EAPI->>SAPI: Forward Request with JWT Token
    SAPI->>SAPI: Validate Token
    SAPI-->>EAPI: Return Result
    EAPI-->>Gateway: Return Response
    Gateway-->>Vendor: Return Response
```

### Token Generation and Validation

JWT tokens are generated for internal service communication after successful authentication. These tokens contain claims that identify the client and specify permissions for accessing internal services.

**Token Structure**:
```json
{
  "sub": "client_id",           // Subject (client identifier)
  "iss": "payment-eapi",        // Issuer
  "aud": "payment-sapi",        // Audience
  "exp": 1623761445,            // Expiration time
  "iat": 1623757845,            // Issued at time
  "jti": "unique-token-id",     // JWT ID (unique identifier)
  "permissions": ["process_payment", "view_status"]  // Custom claim
}
```

**Token Validation**:
1. Extract token from Authorization header
2. Verify token signature using the verification key
3. Check token expiration
4. Validate token claims (issuer, audience, etc.)
5. Check token permissions for the requested operation

### Credential Rotation

The credential rotation process allows for updating authentication credentials without service disruption. The process follows a state machine model with well-defined states and transitions:

1. **INITIATED**: The initial state when a rotation process has been requested but not yet started.

2. **DUAL_ACTIVE**: Both old and new credentials are active and valid during the transition period.

3. **OLD_DEPRECATED**: The old credential is marked as deprecated but still accepted for authentication.

4. **NEW_ACTIVE**: Only the new credential is active, and the old credential has been removed.

5. **FAILED**: The rotation process failed and was rolled back or cancelled.

```mermaid
graph TD
    INITIATED -->|Activate New Credential| DUAL_ACTIVE
    DUAL_ACTIVE -->|Deprecate Old Credential| OLD_DEPRECATED
    OLD_DEPRECATED -->|Remove Old Credential| NEW_ACTIVE
    
    INITIATED -->|Error/Cancel| FAILED
    DUAL_ACTIVE -->|Error/Cancel| FAILED
    OLD_DEPRECATED -->|Error/Cancel| FAILED
```

For detailed information on credential rotation, refer to the [Credential Rotation](credential-rotation.md) document.

### Error Handling and Resilience

The authentication implementation includes comprehensive error handling and resilience mechanisms:

1. **Authentication Errors**: Invalid credentials, missing credentials, malformed credentials

2. **Conjur Vault Errors**: Connection failures, authentication failures, credential retrieval failures

3. **Token Validation Errors**: Invalid token, expired token, insufficient permissions

4. **Resilience Mechanisms**:
   - Circuit breaker for Conjur vault operations
   - Token caching in Redis
   - Fallback to cached credentials when Conjur is unavailable
   - Automatic token renewal
   - Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures

## Data Flow

The data flow in the Payment API Security Enhancement project encompasses authentication data, payment transaction data, and monitoring data.

### Authentication Data Flow

The authentication data flow involves the following steps:

1. **Credential Submission**: XYZ Vendor submits Client ID and Client Secret in request headers to the API Gateway

2. **Credential Forwarding**: API Gateway forwards the request with credentials to Payment-EAPI

3. **Credential Validation**: Payment-EAPI retrieves credentials from Conjur vault and validates the submitted credentials

4. **Token Generation**: Upon successful validation, Payment-EAPI generates a JWT token

5. **Token Caching**: The token is cached in Redis for future use

6. **Token Usage**: Payment-EAPI includes the token in requests to Payment-SAPI

7. **Token Validation**: Payment-SAPI validates the token before processing the request

### Payment Transaction Flow

The payment transaction flow builds on the authentication flow:

1. **Payment Request**: XYZ Vendor submits a payment request with Client ID and Client Secret in headers

2. **Authentication**: The request is authenticated as described in the authentication data flow

3. **Request Forwarding**: Payment-EAPI forwards the authenticated request to Payment-SAPI with a JWT token

4. **Payment Processing**: Payment-SAPI processes the payment transaction through the Payment Backend

5. **Response Return**: The payment result is returned through the chain: Payment Backend → Payment-SAPI → Payment-EAPI → API Gateway → XYZ Vendor

### Monitoring Data Flow

The monitoring data flow captures metrics, logs, and events for system monitoring:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Components expose metrics endpoints that are scraped by Prometheus

2. **Log Generation**: Components generate logs that are collected by the logging infrastructure

3. **Event Publication**: Security events are published to the event bus for processing

4. **Data Aggregation**: Metrics, logs, and events are aggregated for analysis

5. **Visualization**: Dashboards display metrics, logs, and events for monitoring

6. **Alerting**: Alerts are generated based on defined thresholds and conditions

### Data Classification and Handling

Data is classified according to sensitivity, with appropriate handling controls:

| Data Type | Classification | Handling Controls |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Client ID | Sensitive | Encryption, access logging |
| Client Secret | Highly Sensitive | Encryption, never logged, secure handling |
| JWT Tokens | Sensitive | Encryption, signature validation |
| Transaction Data | Sensitive | Encryption, data validation |
| Logs and Metrics | Internal | Anonymization, filtering of sensitive data |

### Data Flow Controls

Data flow controls ensure that data is properly protected as it flows through the system:

1. **Encryption**: All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2+

2. **Authentication**: All data flows between components require authentication

3. **Authorization**: Access to data is controlled based on authorization rules

4. **Validation**: Data is validated at each boundary crossing

5. **Minimization**: Only necessary data is transmitted between components

6. **Monitoring**: Data flows are monitored for anomalies and security issues

It implements industry best practices for security, performance, and operability, providing a solid foundation for the Payment API Security Enhancement project.
