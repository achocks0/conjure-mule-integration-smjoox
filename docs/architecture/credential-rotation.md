# Credential Rotation Architecture

## Introduction

The Credential Rotation Architecture document describes the design and implementation of the credential rotation mechanism in the Payment API Security Enhancement project. This feature enables secure rotation of authentication credentials without service disruption, maintaining backward compatibility with existing vendor integrations.

Credential rotation is a critical security practice that reduces the risk of credential compromise by regularly updating authentication credentials. The architecture described in this document implements a zero-downtime approach to credential rotation, allowing both old and new credentials to be valid during a configurable transition period.

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive architectural overview of the credential rotation mechanism, including:

- The state machine model that governs the rotation process
- The workflow and interactions between components
- The API design for managing rotations
- Security considerations and best practices
- Monitoring and observability aspects
- Failure handling and recovery procedures

This document is intended for software architects, developers, security engineers, and operations personnel involved in the implementation, maintenance, and operation of the Payment API Security Enhancement project.

### Key Requirements

The credential rotation mechanism addresses the following key requirements:

1. **Zero-Downtime Rotation**: Credentials must be rotated without disrupting service availability or vendor operations.

2. **Transition Period Support**: The system must support a configurable transition period during which both old and new credentials are valid.

3. **Secure Credential Management**: All credential operations must be performed securely using Conjur vault for storage and retrieval.

4. **Automated Process**: The rotation process should be largely automated, with appropriate monitoring and controls.

5. **Manual Intervention Capability**: The system must provide mechanisms for manual intervention when needed.

6. **Audit Trail**: All rotation events must be logged for audit and compliance purposes.

### Design Principles

The credential rotation architecture is guided by the following design principles:

1. **Security First**: Security is the primary consideration in all design decisions.

2. **Operational Resilience**: The system must be resilient to failures and provide clear recovery paths.

3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing vendor integrations must continue to function without modification.

4. **Observability**: The rotation process must be transparent and observable through appropriate metrics and logs.

5. **Simplicity**: The design favors simplicity over complexity where possible, while meeting all requirements.

6. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between credential management, rotation orchestration, and application logic.

## Rotation State Machine

The credential rotation process follows a state machine model that defines the possible states and transitions during the rotation lifecycle. This model ensures a controlled and predictable rotation process with well-defined behaviors at each stage.

### State Definitions

The credential rotation state machine consists of the following states:

1. **INITIATED**: The initial state when a rotation process has been requested but not yet started. In this state, the new credential has been generated but is not yet active.

2. **DUAL_ACTIVE**: Both old and new credentials are active and valid during the transition period. Authentication requests can succeed with either credential version.

3. **OLD_DEPRECATED**: The old credential is marked as deprecated but still accepted for authentication. This state allows for any lagging services to complete their transition to the new credential.

4. **NEW_ACTIVE**: Only the new credential is active, and the old credential has been removed. The rotation is considered complete in this state.

5. **FAILED**: The rotation process failed and was rolled back or cancelled. This is a terminal state indicating that the rotation did not complete successfully.

### State Transitions

The following transitions are allowed in the rotation state machine:

1. **INITIATED → DUAL_ACTIVE**: Transition occurs when the new credential is activated alongside the old credential, beginning the transition period.

2. **INITIATED → FAILED**: Transition occurs if there is an error during the initiation phase or if the rotation is cancelled before activation.

3. **DUAL_ACTIVE → OLD_DEPRECATED**: Transition occurs after the transition period ends, marking the old credential as deprecated.

4. **DUAL_ACTIVE → FAILED**: Transition occurs if there is an error during the dual-active phase or if the rotation is cancelled during this phase.

5. **OLD_DEPRECATED → NEW_ACTIVE**: Transition occurs when all services are using the new credential and the old credential can be safely removed.

6. **OLD_DEPRECATED → FAILED**: Transition occurs if there is an error during the deprecation phase or if the rotation is cancelled during this phase.

The NEW_ACTIVE and FAILED states are terminal states with no further transitions allowed.

```

This diagram illustrates the possible state transitions in the credential rotation state machine. The horizontal path represents the successful rotation flow, while the vertical transitions represent failure or cancellation paths.

### State Validation Logic

The rotation service implements validation logic to ensure that state transitions are valid. This logic is implemented in the `isValidNextState` method of the `RotationServiceImpl` class:

```java
private boolean isValidNextState(RotationState currentState, RotationState targetState) {
    switch (currentState) {
        case INITIATED:
            return targetState == RotationState.DUAL_ACTIVE || targetState == RotationState.FAILED;
        case DUAL_ACTIVE:
            return targetState == RotationState.OLD_DEPRECATED || targetState == RotationState.FAILED;
        case OLD_DEPRECATED:
            return targetState == RotationState.NEW_ACTIVE || targetState == RotationState.FAILED;
        case NEW_ACTIVE:
        case FAILED:
            return false; // Terminal states, no further transitions allowed
        default:
            return false;
    }
}
```

This validation ensures that the rotation process follows the defined state machine model and prevents invalid state transitions.

## Rotation Process Flow

The credential rotation process follows a well-defined workflow that orchestrates the transition from old to new credentials while maintaining system availability. This section describes the end-to-end process flow for credential rotation.

### Initiation Phase

The rotation process begins with the initiation phase:

1. **Request Validation**: The rotation request is validated to ensure it contains a valid client ID and appropriate parameters.

2. **Active Rotation Check**: The system checks if there is already an active rotation for the specified client ID. If an active rotation exists and `forceRotation` is not set to true, the request is rejected.

3. **New Credential Generation**: A new credential is generated using the `ConjurService.generateNewCredential()` method, which creates a secure random string for the client secret.

4. **Credential Storage**: The new credential is stored in Conjur vault using the `ConjurService.storeNewCredentialVersion()` method, with a unique version identifier.

5. **Rotation Record Creation**: A rotation record is created with the INITIATED state, including metadata such as client ID, old and new credential versions, and transition period.

6. **Notification**: A notification is sent to relevant stakeholders about the initiated rotation.

At the end of this phase, the new credential exists in Conjur vault but is not yet active for authentication.

### Transition Phase

The transition phase begins when the rotation advances to the DUAL_ACTIVE state:

1. **Dual Credential Configuration**: The system configures Conjur vault to accept both old and new credential versions using the `ConjurService.configureCredentialTransition()` method.

2. **Transition Period Setup**: A transition period is established (default: 60 minutes) during which both credential versions are valid.

3. **State Update**: The rotation record is updated to the DUAL_ACTIVE state.

4. **Monitoring**: The system begins monitoring credential usage to track which version is being used for authentication.

During this phase, authentication requests can succeed with either the old or new credential. This allows services to gradually transition to the new credential without disruption.

### Deprecation Phase

After the transition period expires, the rotation advances to the OLD_DEPRECATED state:

1. **Old Credential Deprecation**: The old credential is marked as deprecated using the `ConjurService.disableCredentialVersion()` method, but it remains valid for authentication.

2. **State Update**: The rotation record is updated to the OLD_DEPRECATED state.

3. **Usage Monitoring**: The system continues monitoring credential usage to determine when all services have transitioned to the new credential.

During this phase, the old credential is still accepted for authentication, but the system logs warnings when it is used. This phase continues until all services are consistently using the new credential.

### Completion Phase

When all services are using the new credential, the rotation advances to the NEW_ACTIVE state:

1. **Old Credential Removal**: The old credential is removed from Conjur vault using the `ConjurService.removeCredentialVersion()` method.

2. **State Update**: The rotation record is updated to the NEW_ACTIVE state, and the completion timestamp is set.

3. **Notification**: A notification is sent to relevant stakeholders about the completed rotation.

At the end of this phase, only the new credential is active, and the rotation is considered complete.

### Cancellation Flow

If necessary, a rotation can be cancelled at any point before completion:

1. **Cancellation Request**: A cancellation request is received with a rotation ID and reason.

2. **Current State Determination**: The system determines the current state of the rotation to perform appropriate cleanup actions.

3. **Cleanup Actions**: Based on the current state, the system performs cleanup actions:
   - For INITIATED: Remove the new credential version
   - For DUAL_ACTIVE: Remove the new credential version, reconfigure old credential as sole active version
   - For OLD_DEPRECATED: Reactivate old credential, remove new credential version

4. **State Update**: The rotation record is updated to the FAILED state, with the completion timestamp set and the failure reason recorded.

5. **Notification**: A notification is sent to relevant stakeholders about the cancelled rotation.

The cancellation flow ensures that the system returns to a consistent state with the original credential active.

### Automatic Progression

The rotation process includes automatic progression mechanisms:

1. **Scheduled Monitoring**: The `checkRotationProgress()` method runs on a scheduled basis to check the progress of active rotations.

2. **Transition Period Expiration**: When the transition period expires for a rotation in the DUAL_ACTIVE state, the system automatically advances it to the OLD_DEPRECATED state.

3. **Usage-Based Advancement**: When all services are consistently using the new credential for a rotation in the OLD_DEPRECATED state, the system automatically advances it to the NEW_ACTIVE state.

This automatic progression ensures that rotations complete in a timely manner without requiring manual intervention under normal circumstances.

## Component Architecture

The credential rotation mechanism is implemented through a set of components that work together to provide a secure and reliable rotation process. This section describes the key components and their interactions.

### Component Overview

The credential rotation architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **RotationController**: REST controller that exposes API endpoints for managing credential rotations.

2. **RotationService**: Service that orchestrates the rotation process, managing state transitions and coordinating with other components.

3. **ConjurService**: Service that interfaces with Conjur vault for secure credential management operations.

4. **NotificationService**: Service that sends notifications about rotation events to relevant stakeholders.

5. **RotationScheduler**: Component that periodically checks rotation progress and advances rotations when appropriate.

6. **Conjur Vault**: External system that securely stores and manages credentials.

7. **Redis Cache**: Caching layer that stores authentication tokens and credential metadata.

These components work together to implement the credential rotation mechanism, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces.

### Component Interactions

The components interact in the following ways during the rotation process:

1. **Rotation Initiation**:
   - RotationController receives a rotation request and forwards it to RotationService
   - RotationService validates the request and calls ConjurService to generate and store a new credential
   - RotationService creates a rotation record and calls NotificationService to send a notification

2. **Transition Phase**:
   - RotationService calls ConjurService to configure dual credential validation
   - Authentication services retrieve both credential versions from Conjur vault
   - Redis cache stores tokens generated with either credential version

3. **Automatic Progression**:
   - RotationScheduler periodically calls RotationService.checkRotationProgress()
   - RotationService checks transition period expiration and credential usage
   - RotationService advances rotations to the next state when conditions are met

4. **Rotation Completion**:
   - RotationService calls ConjurService to remove the old credential
   - RotationService updates the rotation record to the NEW_ACTIVE state
   - NotificationService sends a completion notification

These interactions ensure a coordinated rotation process with appropriate checks and balances.

```

This diagram illustrates the component architecture for credential rotation, showing the key components and their relationships.

### RotationService Implementation

The `RotationService` is the central component that orchestrates the credential rotation process. It is implemented by the `RotationServiceImpl` class, which provides the following key methods:

1. **initiateRotation**: Initiates a new credential rotation process for the specified client.

2. **advanceRotation**: Advances a rotation process to the next state.

3. **completeRotation**: Completes a rotation process by finalizing the transition to the new credential.

4. **cancelRotation**: Cancels an in-progress rotation process.

5. **checkRotationProgress**: Checks the progress of ongoing rotations and advances them if necessary.

6. **getRotationStatus**: Retrieves the current status of a credential rotation process.

7. **getRotationsByClientId**: Retrieves all rotation processes for a specific client ID.

8. **getActiveRotations**: Retrieves all currently active rotation processes.

The `RotationService` maintains the state machine logic and coordinates with other components to ensure a smooth rotation process.

### ConjurService Implementation

The `ConjurService` is responsible for secure credential management operations with Conjur vault. It is implemented by the `ConjurServiceImpl` class, which provides the following key methods:

1. **generateNewCredential**: Generates a new credential for rotation purposes.

2. **storeNewCredentialVersion**: Stores a new version of a credential during rotation.

3. **retrieveCredentialVersion**: Retrieves a specific version of a credential from Conjur vault.

4. **configureCredentialTransition**: Configures Conjur vault for a credential transition period where both old and new credentials are valid.

5. **disableCredentialVersion**: Disables a specific version of a credential in Conjur vault.

6. **removeCredentialVersion**: Removes a specific version of a credential from Conjur vault.

7. **getActiveCredentialVersions**: Retrieves all active credential versions for a client ID.

8. **getCredentialTransitionStatus**: Retrieves the current transition status for a credential.

The `ConjurService` implements secure credential management practices, including retry logic for transient failures and proper error handling.

## API Design

The credential rotation mechanism exposes a RESTful API for managing rotation processes. This section describes the API design, including endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

### API Endpoints

The rotation API is exposed through the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Request Body | Response |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `/api/v1/rotations/initiate` | POST | Initiate a new credential rotation | RotationRequest | RotationResponse |
| `/api/v1/rotations/{rotationId}` | GET | Get status of a specific rotation | None | RotationResponse |
| `/api/v1/rotations/client/{clientId}` | GET | Get all rotations for a client | None | List<RotationResponse> |
| `/api/v1/rotations/active` | GET | Get all active rotations | None | List<RotationResponse> |
| `/api/v1/rotations/{rotationId}/advance` | PUT | Advance rotation to next state | targetState parameter | RotationResponse |
| `/api/v1/rotations/{rotationId}/complete` | PUT | Complete a rotation | None | RotationResponse |
| `/api/v1/rotations/{rotationId}` | DELETE | Cancel a rotation | reason parameter | RotationResponse |

These endpoints provide a comprehensive interface for managing credential rotations throughout their lifecycle.

### Request and Response Models

The API uses the following models for requests and responses:

**RotationRequest**:
```json
{
  "clientId": "vendor_client_id",
  "reason": "Scheduled rotation",
  "transitionPeriodMinutes": 60,
  "forceRotation": false,
  "targetState": null
}
```

- `clientId`: Required. The client ID for which to rotate credentials.
- `reason`: Optional. The reason for the rotation (for audit purposes).
- `transitionPeriodMinutes`: Optional. The duration of the transition period in minutes (default: 60).
- `forceRotation`: Optional. Whether to force rotation if another rotation is in progress (default: false).
- `targetState`: Optional. The target state for manual state transitions.

**RotationResponse**:
```json
{
  "rotationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "clientId": "vendor_client_id",
  "currentState": "DUAL_ACTIVE",
  "targetState": "NEW_ACTIVE",
  "oldVersion": "v1",
  "newVersion": "v2",
  "transitionPeriodMinutes": 60,
  "startedAt": "2023-06-15T10:30:45Z",
  "completedAt": null,
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
  "message": "Rotation in dual-active phase",
  "success": true
}
```

- `rotationId`: Unique identifier for the rotation process.
- `clientId`: The client ID for which credentials are being rotated.
- `currentState`: The current state of the rotation (INITIATED, DUAL_ACTIVE, OLD_DEPRECATED, NEW_ACTIVE, FAILED).
- `targetState`: The target state for the rotation (typically NEW_ACTIVE).
- `oldVersion`: The version identifier for the old credential.
- `newVersion`: The version identifier for the new credential.
- `transitionPeriodMinutes`: The duration of the transition period in minutes.
- `startedAt`: Timestamp when the rotation was initiated.
- `completedAt`: Timestamp when the rotation was completed or failed (null if in progress).
- `status`: Status of the rotation (IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED).
- `message`: Human-readable message about the rotation status.
- `success`: Whether the operation was successful.

### Authentication and Authorization

The rotation API requires appropriate authentication and authorization:

1. **Authentication**: All API requests must include an administrative authentication token in the Authorization header.

2. **Authorization**: Access to the rotation API is restricted to users with the appropriate administrative role (typically Security Administrator or Operations Administrator).

3. **Audit Logging**: All API requests are logged for audit purposes, including the authenticated user, action performed, and relevant parameters.

This ensures that credential rotation operations are performed only by authorized personnel and are properly tracked for compliance purposes.

### Error Handling

The API implements consistent error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses:

| Error Scenario | HTTP Status | Error Code | Description |
|----------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Invalid request parameters | 400 Bad Request | INVALID_REQUEST | Missing or invalid parameters in rotation request |
| Invalid rotation ID | 404 Not Found | ROTATION_NOT_FOUND | Specified rotation ID does not exist |
| Invalid state transition | 400 Bad Request | INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION | Attempted to transition to an invalid next state |
| Rotation in progress | 409 Conflict | ROTATION_IN_PROGRESS | Another rotation is already in progress for the client |
| Conjur connection error | 503 Service Unavailable | CONJUR_CONNECTION_ERROR | Unable to connect to Conjur vault |
| System error | 500 Internal Server Error | SYSTEM_ERROR | Unexpected system error |

**Error Response Format**:
```json
{
  "rotationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "clientId": "vendor_client_id",
  "currentState": null,
  "targetState": null,
  "message": "Invalid request parameters: clientId is required",
  "success": false
}
```

This consistent error handling ensures that clients can properly handle error scenarios and take appropriate actions.

### API Usage Examples

## Security Considerations

Security is a primary consideration in the credential rotation architecture. This section describes the security measures implemented to protect credentials and ensure the integrity of the rotation process.

### Credential Protection

The credential rotation mechanism implements multiple layers of protection for credentials:

1. **Secure Storage**: All credentials are stored in Conjur vault, which provides encrypted storage with strong access controls.

2. **Secure Generation**: New credentials are generated using cryptographically secure random number generators with sufficient entropy.

3. **Secure Transmission**: All communication with Conjur vault occurs over TLS 1.2+ with certificate validation.

4. **Credential Masking**: Credentials are masked in logs and error messages to prevent exposure.

5. **Memory Protection**: Credentials are stored as character arrays rather than strings when possible, and are zeroed out after use.

6. **Minimal Exposure**: Credentials are retrieved only when needed and are not persisted in application memory longer than necessary.

These measures ensure that credentials are protected throughout their lifecycle, from generation to storage to eventual removal.

### Access Controls

The credential rotation mechanism implements strict access controls:

1. **API Access Control**: Access to the rotation API is restricted to authorized administrators with appropriate roles.

2. **Conjur Vault Access Control**: Access to credentials in Conjur vault is controlled by fine-grained policies that implement the principle of least privilege.

3. **Service Authentication**: Services that access Conjur vault authenticate using service-specific credentials or certificates.

4. **Separation of Duties**: Different roles are required for initiating rotations, approving rotations, and managing the underlying infrastructure.

5. **Audit Logging**: All access to credentials and rotation operations is logged for audit purposes.

These access controls ensure that only authorized personnel and services can perform credential operations or initiate rotations.

### Secure Rotation Process

The rotation process itself is designed with security in mind:

1. **Zero Knowledge**: The rotation service never has access to the actual credential values, only to metadata about the credentials.

2. **Atomic Operations**: Credential operations are designed to be atomic to prevent inconsistent states.

3. **Validation**: All rotation requests and state transitions are validated before execution.

4. **Rollback**: The system supports rollback in case of failures to ensure that credentials remain valid.

5. **Monitoring**: The rotation process is monitored for anomalies that might indicate security issues.

6. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse.

These measures ensure that the rotation process itself does not introduce security vulnerabilities.

### Threat Mitigation

The credential rotation architecture includes mitigations for common threats:

1. **Unauthorized Access**: Mitigated through strong authentication, authorization, and access controls.

2. **Credential Exposure**: Mitigated through secure storage, transmission, and handling of credentials.

3. **Denial of Service**: Mitigated through rate limiting, resource constraints, and monitoring.

4. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Mitigated through TLS with certificate validation for all communications.

5. **Insider Threats**: Mitigated through separation of duties, audit logging, and monitoring.

6. **Credential Compromise**: Mitigated through regular rotation and the ability to perform emergency rotations if needed.

These mitigations address the most significant threats to the credential rotation mechanism and the credentials it manages.

### Security Testing

The credential rotation mechanism undergoes rigorous security testing:

1. **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed for security vulnerabilities using tools like SonarQube and SpotBugs.

2. **Dependency Scanning**: Dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency Check.

3. **Dynamic Analysis**: API endpoints are tested for security vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP.

4. **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing is performed to identify potential vulnerabilities.

5. **Security Review**: Security experts review the design and implementation for potential issues.

6. **Compliance Validation**: The implementation is validated against relevant security standards and compliance requirements.

This comprehensive testing approach helps identify and address security issues before they can be exploited.

## Monitoring and Observability

Effective monitoring and observability are essential for ensuring the reliability and security of the credential rotation process. This section describes the monitoring and observability aspects of the credential rotation architecture.

### Key Metrics

The credential rotation mechanism exposes the following key metrics for monitoring:

1. **Rotation Counts**: Number of rotations initiated, completed, and failed over time.

2. **Rotation Duration**: Time taken for rotations to complete, broken down by phase.

3. **State Transition Counts**: Number of transitions between different rotation states.

4. **Credential Usage**: Usage patterns of old vs. new credentials during rotation.

5. **Error Counts**: Number and types of errors encountered during rotation.

6. **API Request Rates**: Rate of requests to rotation API endpoints.

7. **Conjur Vault Operations**: Number and latency of operations against Conjur vault.

These metrics provide visibility into the health and performance of the rotation mechanism and help identify potential issues.

### Logging Strategy

The credential rotation mechanism implements a comprehensive logging strategy:

1. **Rotation Events**: All significant rotation events are logged, including initiations, state transitions, completions, and cancellations.

2. **Error Logging**: Errors are logged with appropriate context and stack traces, but without exposing sensitive information.

3. **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant events are logged to a separate audit log for compliance purposes.

4. **Structured Logging**: Logs are structured in JSON format to facilitate parsing and analysis.

5. **Correlation IDs**: All logs related to a specific rotation include the rotation ID for correlation.

6. **Log Levels**: Different log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) are used appropriately to distinguish between normal operations and issues.

This logging strategy ensures that operators have the information they need to monitor and troubleshoot the rotation process.

### Alerting

The monitoring system includes alerts for potential issues:

1. **Failed Rotations**: Alert when a rotation fails or is cancelled.

2. **Stuck Rotations**: Alert when a rotation remains in the same state for an extended period.

3. **High Error Rates**: Alert when the error rate for rotation operations exceeds a threshold.

4. **Conjur Vault Issues**: Alert when there are connectivity or authentication issues with Conjur vault.

5. **Credential Usage Anomalies**: Alert when credential usage patterns deviate significantly from expected patterns.

6. **API Availability**: Alert when the rotation API becomes unavailable or experiences high latency.

These alerts help operators identify and address issues before they impact system availability or security.

### Dashboards

The monitoring system includes dashboards for visualizing rotation-related metrics and logs:

1. **Rotation Overview**: High-level view of rotation counts, success rates, and durations.

2. **Active Rotations**: Details of currently active rotations, including their states and progress.

3. **Credential Usage**: Visualization of credential usage patterns during and after rotation.

4. **Error Analysis**: Breakdown of errors by type, frequency, and impact.

5. **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, and resource utilization for rotation-related components.

6. **Audit Trail**: Timeline of security-relevant events for compliance and investigation purposes.

These dashboards provide operators with the visibility they need to monitor and manage the rotation process effectively.

### Health Checks

The credential rotation mechanism includes health checks for key components:

1. **API Health**: Check that the rotation API is responsive and returning correct responses.

2. **Conjur Vault Connectivity**: Check that the system can connect to and authenticate with Conjur vault.

3. **Redis Cache Health**: Check that the Redis cache is available and functioning correctly.

4. **Database Health**: Check that the database for storing rotation records is available and functioning correctly.

5. **Rotation Service Health**: Check that the rotation service is processing rotations correctly.

These health checks are exposed through a health endpoint that can be monitored by infrastructure monitoring systems.

## Failure Handling

The credential rotation architecture includes comprehensive failure handling to ensure system resilience and data consistency. This section describes how the system handles various failure scenarios.

### Failure Scenarios

The system is designed to handle the following failure scenarios:

1. **Conjur Vault Unavailability**: Temporary or extended unavailability of Conjur vault.

2. **Redis Cache Failures**: Failures in the Redis cache used for token storage.

3. **Database Failures**: Failures in the database used for storing rotation records.

4. **Network Issues**: Temporary or extended network connectivity problems.

5. **Service Failures**: Failures in the rotation service or related components.

6. **Concurrent Operation Conflicts**: Conflicts arising from concurrent rotation operations.

7. **Invalid State Transitions**: Attempts to perform invalid state transitions.

The system implements specific strategies for handling each of these failure scenarios.

### Retry Mechanisms

The system implements retry mechanisms for transient failures:

1. **Exponential Backoff**: Retry operations with exponential backoff to handle temporary issues.

2. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when a service is unavailable.

3. **Idempotent Operations**: Design operations to be idempotent so they can be safely retried.

4. **Retry Limits**: Set appropriate limits on retry attempts to avoid infinite retry loops.

5. **Retry Logging**: Log retry attempts and outcomes for monitoring and troubleshooting.

These retry mechanisms help the system recover from transient failures without manual intervention.

### Fallback Strategies

The system implements fallback strategies for handling extended failures:

1. **Cached Credentials**: Use cached credentials when Conjur vault is unavailable.

2. **Degraded Operation**: Continue operating in a degraded mode when non-critical components are unavailable.

3. **Manual Intervention**: Provide mechanisms for manual intervention when automated processes fail.

4. **Alternative Paths**: Implement alternative execution paths for critical operations.

5. **Graceful Degradation**: Degrade functionality gracefully rather than failing completely.

These fallback strategies ensure that the system can continue operating even when some components are unavailable.

### Transaction Management

The system implements transaction management to ensure data consistency:

1. **Database Transactions**: Use database transactions to ensure that related database operations succeed or fail as a unit.

2. **Compensating Transactions**: Implement compensating transactions to undo the effects of failed operations.

3. **Two-Phase Operations**: Split critical operations into preparation and execution phases to minimize the risk of inconsistent states.

4. **State Verification**: Verify system state before and after critical operations to detect inconsistencies.

5. **Audit Trail**: Maintain an audit trail of all operations for recovery and investigation purposes.

These transaction management strategies help maintain data consistency even in the face of failures.

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Automated Recovery**: Implement automated recovery procedures for common failure scenarios.

2. **Manual Recovery**: Document manual recovery procedures for scenarios that require human intervention.

3. **Data Reconciliation**: Provide tools for reconciling data between different components after a failure.

4. **State Repair**: Implement mechanisms for repairing inconsistent states.

5. **Rollback Capability**: Support rolling back to a previous known-good state when necessary.

These recovery procedures ensure that the system can be restored to a consistent state after a failure.

### Failure Notification

The system implements failure notification to ensure timely response:

1. **Error Logging**: Log detailed error information for investigation and troubleshooting.

2. **Alert Generation**: Generate alerts for critical failures that require immediate attention.

3. **Status Updates**: Provide status updates during extended recovery operations.

4. **Stakeholder Notification**: Notify relevant stakeholders about significant failures and their impact.

5. **Escalation Paths**: Define clear escalation paths for different types of failures.

These notification mechanisms ensure that failures are detected and addressed promptly.
