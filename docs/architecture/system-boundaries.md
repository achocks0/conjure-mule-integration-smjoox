# System Boundaries Architecture

## Introduction

This document describes the system boundaries for the Payment API Security Enhancement project. System boundaries define the logical and physical separation between different components, security zones, and external systems. Understanding these boundaries is critical for implementing proper security controls, ensuring isolation between components with different trust levels, and maintaining the integrity of the payment processing system.

The Payment API Security Enhancement project implements a layered architecture with clear boundaries between external-facing and internal components. This approach allows for enhanced security internally while maintaining backward compatibility with existing vendor integrations.

### Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the system boundaries for the Payment API Security Enhancement project, including:

- Types of system boundaries (logical, physical, security, etc.)
- Security zones and trust boundaries
- API boundaries and contracts
- Data flow boundaries
- Deployment boundaries
- Boundary controls and protection mechanisms

This document is intended for security architects, system architects, developers, security engineers, and operations personnel involved in the implementation, maintenance, and operation of the Payment API Security Enhancement project.

### Key Requirements

The system boundaries address the following key requirements:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of boundaries to protect against various threats.

2. **Clear Separation**: Maintain clear separation between components with different trust levels.

3. **Secure Communication**: Ensure secure communication across boundaries.

4. **Access Control**: Implement appropriate access controls at boundary crossings.

5. **Monitoring**: Monitor boundary crossings for security events and anomalies.

6. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing vendor integrations while enhancing security.

### Design Principles

The system boundaries design is guided by the following principles:

1. **Least Privilege**: Components should have only the access necessary for their function.

2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple boundary layers provide redundant protection.

3. **Secure by Default**: Default configurations deny access unless explicitly allowed.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between different functions and security zones.

5. **Explicit Trust Boundaries**: Trust boundaries are explicitly defined and protected.

6. **Boundary Validation**: All data crossing boundaries is validated.

## System Boundary Types

The Payment API Security Enhancement project implements several types of system boundaries, each serving a specific purpose in the overall security architecture.

### Logical Boundaries

Logical boundaries define the separation between different software components and functions:

1. **Component Boundaries**: Separation between different software components (Payment-EAPI, Payment-SAPI, Conjur Vault, Redis Cache).

2. **Function Boundaries**: Separation between different functions within components (authentication, payment processing, token management).

3. **Service Boundaries**: Separation between different services (external API, internal API, security services).

4. **Data Boundaries**: Separation between different types of data (credentials, tokens, payment data).

Logical boundaries are implemented through software design patterns, interface definitions, and access controls.

### Physical Boundaries

Physical boundaries define the separation between different hardware and infrastructure components:

1. **Network Boundaries**: Separation between different network segments (DMZ, Application Network, Internal Network, Security Network).

2. **Host Boundaries**: Separation between different hosts and servers.

3. **Container Boundaries**: Separation between different containers and pods in Kubernetes.

4. **Data Center Boundaries**: Separation between different data centers or availability zones.

Physical boundaries are implemented through network segmentation, firewalls, and infrastructure design.

### Security Boundaries

Security boundaries define the separation between different security domains:

1. **Trust Boundaries**: Separation between domains with different trust levels.

2. **Authentication Boundaries**: Points where authentication occurs.

3. **Authorization Boundaries**: Points where authorization decisions are made.

4. **Encryption Boundaries**: Points where data is encrypted or decrypted.

Security boundaries are implemented through authentication mechanisms, authorization controls, and encryption.

### Organizational Boundaries

Organizational boundaries define the separation between different organizational entities:

1. **Vendor Boundaries**: Separation between the organization and external vendors.

2. **Team Boundaries**: Separation between different internal teams (development, operations, security).

3. **Responsibility Boundaries**: Separation between different areas of responsibility.

Organizational boundaries are implemented through policies, procedures, and access controls.

## Security Zones and Trust Boundaries

The system is divided into distinct security zones, each with a defined trust level and appropriate security controls. Trust boundaries exist at the interfaces between these zones, where additional security controls are required to protect against threats.

### Security Zone Definitions

The system is divided into the following security zones:

1. **External Zone**: Contains external clients (XYZ Vendor) and the public internet. This zone is considered untrusted.

2. **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: Contains the API Gateway, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Load Balancer. This zone handles external traffic and provides the first layer of defense.

3. **Application Zone**: Contains the Payment-EAPI and Redis Cache. This zone processes authenticated requests and manages token caching.

4. **Internal Zone**: Contains the Payment-SAPI and backend systems. This zone processes payment transactions after authentication.

5. **Security Zone**: Contains Conjur Vault and security infrastructure. This zone stores sensitive credentials and cryptographic material.

6. **Monitoring Zone**: Contains logging and monitoring systems. This zone collects and analyzes security events and metrics.

### Trust Levels

Each security zone has a defined trust level that determines the security controls applied:

| Zone | Trust Level | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| External Zone | Untrusted | No trust assumptions, all traffic must be validated and authenticated |
| DMZ | Semi-trusted | Limited trust, traffic is filtered but still requires validation |
| Application Zone | Trusted | Higher trust level, but still requires authentication and authorization |
| Internal Zone | Trusted | Higher trust level, internal services with controlled access |
| Security Zone | Highly trusted | Highest trust level, contains sensitive security components |
| Monitoring Zone | Trusted | Collects and analyzes security data with controlled access |

### Trust Boundaries

Trust boundaries exist at the interfaces between security zones with different trust levels:

1. **External to DMZ Boundary**: Boundary between untrusted external systems and semi-trusted DMZ components. This boundary implements strict filtering, rate limiting, and initial validation.

2. **DMZ to Application Boundary**: Boundary between semi-trusted DMZ and trusted application components. This boundary implements authentication and more detailed validation.

3. **Application to Internal Boundary**: Boundary between application components and internal services. This boundary implements token-based authentication and authorization.

4. **Application to Security Boundary**: Boundary between application components and security components. This boundary implements strong authentication and strict access controls.

5. **All Zones to Monitoring Boundary**: Boundary between all zones and monitoring components. This boundary implements one-way data flow for logs and metrics.

### Trust Boundary Controls

Each trust boundary implements appropriate security controls:

| Trust Boundary | Security Controls | Validation Requirements |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| External to DMZ | WAF, DDoS protection, TLS termination | Request format, rate limiting, basic validation |
| DMZ to Application | Authentication, input validation, TLS | Credential validation, request validation |
| Application to Internal | Token validation, authorization, TLS | Token integrity, permissions, request validation |
| Application to Security | Certificate authentication, TLS | Certificate validation, request authorization |
| All Zones to Monitoring | One-way communication, TLS | Data format validation |

## Deployment Boundaries

Deployment boundaries define the separation between different deployment environments and infrastructure components. These boundaries ensure proper isolation between environments and components.

### Environment Boundaries

Environment boundaries separate different deployment environments:

1. **Development Environment**: Used for development and testing. Isolated from other environments.

2. **Testing Environment**: Used for integration and system testing. Isolated from development and production.

3. **Staging Environment**: Used for pre-production validation. Configured similarly to production but isolated.

4. **Production Environment**: Used for live operations. Strictly isolated from other environments.
