# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Payment API Security Enhancement project is a comprehensive initiative designed to strengthen the security of an existing payment processing system while maintaining backward compatibility with current vendor integrations. The project addresses a critical security vulnerability in the current authentication mechanism by replacing header-based Client ID and Client Secret authentication with a more secure approach leveraging Conjur vault for credential management and JWT tokens for internal service communication.

## Core Business Problem

The current payment processing system exposes sensitive authentication credentials in API headers, creating potential security vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access and financial fraud. This project implements a layered security approach that enhances protection of these credentials while ensuring existing vendor integrations continue to function without modification.

## Key Features

- **Secure Credential Storage**: Implementation of Conjur vault for secure storage and management of authentication credentials, eliminating exposure of raw credentials in the system
- **Token-based Authentication**: JWT token implementation for secure internal service communication, replacing the vulnerable header-based approach
- **Backward Compatibility Layer**: Maintenance of the existing API contract with vendors while implementing enhanced security internally
- **Credential Rotation Mechanism**: Zero-downtime credential rotation capability that allows security updates without service disruption
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Robust monitoring and observability for security events, authentication patterns, and system health

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation between external-facing and internal components:

## Key Workflows

### Authentication Flow

1. Vendor sends request with Client ID and Client Secret in headers to Payment-EAPI
2. Payment-EAPI extracts credentials from headers
3. Payment-EAPI retrieves stored credentials from Conjur vault
4. Payment-EAPI validates provided credentials against stored credentials
5. If valid, Payment-EAPI generates JWT token
6. Payment-EAPI caches token in Redis
7. Payment-EAPI forwards request to Payment-SAPI with JWT token
8. Payment-SAPI validates token
9. If valid, Payment-SAPI processes request
10. Payment-SAPI returns response to Payment-EAPI
11. Payment-EAPI returns response to vendor

### Token Validation Flow

1. Payment-SAPI receives request with JWT token
2. TokenAuthenticationFilter extracts token from Authorization header
3. TokenValidationService validates token signature
4. TokenValidationService checks token expiration
5. If expired and renewal enabled, TokenRenewalService attempts to renew token
6. TokenValidationService validates token permissions
7. If all validations pass, request is processed
8. If any validation fails, appropriate error response is returned

### Credential Rotation Flow

1. RotationService initiates rotation for a client ID
2. ConjurService generates new credentials
3. ConjurService stores new credentials in Conjur vault
4. RotationService configures transition period (DUAL_ACTIVE state)
5. RotationScheduler periodically checks rotation progress
6. When transition period ends, old credentials are deprecated (OLD_DEPRECATED state)
7. When all services are using new credentials, old credentials are removed (NEW_ACTIVE state)
8. NotificationService sends notifications about rotation events

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security

- Client credentials are securely stored in Conjur vault
- Credentials are never logged or exposed in responses
- JWT tokens are signed with HMAC SHA-256
- Tokens have a configurable expiration time
- Token validation includes signature verification, expiration checking, and permission validation

### Network Security

- All communication uses TLS 1.2+
- Network policies restrict communication between services
- Sensitive services (Conjur vault) are isolated in a secure network zone

   - Static fields
   - Instance fields
   - Constructors
   - Public methods
   - Protected methods
   - Private methods
   - Inner classes/interfaces
5. **Visibility**: Use the most restrictive visibility possible

### Interface and Implementation Separation

The project follows the interface-implementation separation pattern:

1. **Interfaces**: Define the contract for a service or component
2. **Implementations**: Implement the interface contract
3. **Dependency Injection**: Components depend on interfaces, not implementations

Interfaces should be placed in the service package, while implementations should be in the service.impl package.

### Design Patterns

The project uses the following design patterns:

1. **Dependency Injection**: Spring's constructor injection for dependencies
2. **Factory Pattern**: For creating complex objects
3. **Builder Pattern**: For objects with many optional parameters
4. **Strategy Pattern**: For interchangeable algorithms
5. **Adapter Pattern**: For integrating with external systems
6. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: For resilience in external service calls
7. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction

## Documentation Standards

### Javadoc Standards

Javadoc comments must be provided for:

1. **All public classes and interfaces**
2. **All public and protected methods**

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

The project follows a modified Git Flow branching strategy:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for feature development
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new features
- `bugfix/*`: Bugfix branches for bug fixes
- `release/*`: Release branches for release preparation
- `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches for urgent production fixes

Workflow:
1. Create a feature or bugfix branch from `develop`
2. Implement your changes with appropriate tests
3. Submit a pull request to merge back to `develop`
4. After review and approval, the changes are merged to `develop`
5. Periodically, a release branch is created from `develop`
6. After testing, the release branch is merged to `main` and tagged with a version number

### Pull Request Process

Follow these steps when submitting a pull request:

1. Ensure your code follows the project's code standards
2. Write appropriate tests for your changes
3. Update documentation as necessary
4. Run the build locally to ensure it passes
5. Create a pull request with a clear description of the changes
6. Reference any related issues in the pull request description
7. Respond to review comments and make necessary changes
8. Once approved, the pull request will be merged

Pull requests are automatically built and tested by the CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline runs the following checks:
- Build and unit tests
- Code style checks
- Static analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Integration tests

All checks must pass before a pull request can be merged.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Issues

- **Maven build fails with compilation errors**
  - Ensure you have Java 11 or later installed
  - Check for missing dependencies
  - Verify that your code follows the project's code standards

- **Tests fail during build**
  - Check the test logs for specific failures
  - Ensure that required services (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.) are running
  - Verify that your changes don't break existing functionality

#### Runtime Issues

- **Application fails to start**
  - Check the application logs for error messages
  - Verify that required services (Redis, PostgreSQL, Conjur vault) are running
  - Check the configuration properties for errors

- **Authentication failures**
  - Verify that the Client ID and Client Secret are correct
  - Check that the credentials are properly stored in Conjur vault
  - Verify that the Conjur vault is accessible
  - Check the authentication service logs for specific errors

### Logging and Debugging

#### Logging Configuration

The application uses SLF4J with Logback for logging. The logging configuration is defined in the `logback-spring.xml` file in each module's `src/main/resources` directory.

You can adjust the log levels in the application properties:

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    root: INFO
    com.payment: DEBUG
    org.springframework: INFO
```

#### Debugging Techniques

- **Enable DEBUG logging**: Set the log level to DEBUG for specific packages to get more detailed logs
- **Use remote debugging**: Attach a debugger to the running application
- **Inspect Redis cache**: Use Redis CLI or Redis Commander to inspect the cached tokens and credentials
- **Check Conjur vault**: Use the Conjur UI or CLI to verify that credentials are properly stored
- **Monitor API calls**: Use tools like Postman or curl to make API calls and inspect the responses
- **Check metrics**: Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application metrics
- **Analyze logs**: Use the ELK stack to analyze application logs
