The Payment API Security Enhancement project aims to improve the security postureof the existing payment processing system without impacting external vendorintegrations. Currently, the "Payment-Eapi" authenticates vendor requests usingClient ID and Client Secret authentication passed in request headers. This project willimplement a more secure authentication mechanism by leveraging Conjur vault forcredential management while maintaining backward compatibility with existing vendorintegrations.

Core Business Problem:

The current authentication mechanism exposes sensitivecredentials in API headers, creating potential security vulnerabilities. This projectaddresses this risk by implementing token-based authentication with securecredential storage in Conjur vault.

Key Stakeholders and Users:

XYZ Vendor (API Consumer)

Payment Processing Team

Security and Compliance Team

API Management Team

Operations Support Team

Expected Business Impact and Value Proposition:

Enhanced security posture without disrupting existing business operations

Reduced risk of credential exposure and potential security breaches

Improved compliance with security best practices and standards

Minimal implementation cost with no changes required from vendor side

SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Project Context

Aspect

Description

BusinessContext

The payment processing API is a critical component of theorganization's financial infrastructure, handling sensitivepayment transactions from external vendors.

CurrentLimitations

The existing authentication mechanism relies on Client ID andClient Secret passed in headers, which presents security risksif intercepted or leaked.

EnterpriseIntegration

The system integrates with the existing API gateway,authentication services, and payment processing backendsystems.

High-Level Description

The payment processing system consists of two primary components:

1.

Payment-Eapi (External API)

: Public-facing API that authenticates vendorrequests and forwards them to the internal service.

2.

Payment-Sapi (System API)

 Internal service that processes payment transactions and returns results to the external API.

The core technical approach involves:

Maintaining the existing API contract with XYZ Vendor

Implementing Conjur vault integration for secure credential storage

Adding token-based authentication internally while preserving header-basedauthentication externally

Ensuring zero downtime during implementation
